# terminal-game-engine-thing
I never came up with a name for it... text based iron-lung inspired terminal game engine

Create a .txt file in the /filesystems folder to create a page

You will need to edit the main.py file manually to change the startup page (currently from an old project of mine which I also never ended up finishing)

Needs a terminal that supports ANSI colouring
