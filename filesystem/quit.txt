why should i quit..?
i still haven't found it!

i wonder just how high it went?
it flew up and up and up!

do you think i'll ever reach it?
i'll climb and climb and climb until i do!

what colour was it again? was it green?
oh yes, blue with a tip of red!

maybe it's up with the treetops...
maybe it's up with the clouds...
maybe it's up with the stars...

i'll find it, i have to
